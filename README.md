# Onkeydown Only Number and Dot
This function will prevent entry of anything other than numbers and a single dot.

===========================================================

Use Jquery instead. Add a decimal class to your textbox 

Use this code in your JS. It checks for multiple decimals and also restrict users to type only numbers.
